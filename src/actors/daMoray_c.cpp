/* daMoray_c — Jolly Roger Bay eel (MORAY).
 *
 * Five states, installed by func_ov016_02111bf0. The tables are filled by
 * __sinit_ov016_021136ec from the pointer-to-member words at 0x02114878:
 *   02114d8c  den wait     init 02111bac, execute 021119ec
 *   02114d9c  lunge        init 02111860, execute 02111758
 *   02114dac  swim out     init 02111994, execute 021118b4
 *   02114dbc  path swim    init 02111718, execute 021115c0
 *   02114d7c  retreat      init BookSwitch_Spawn, execute func_ov016_02111534
 * BookSwitch_Spawn sets mStateTimer to 100 and mHorzSpeed to 0x14000;
 * func_ov016_02111534 restores the spawn angles when that timer hits 0 and
 * goes back to den wait.
 *
 * BookSwitch_Spawn is the configured symbol name, not an identity. It came
 * from the automated spawn-table naming pass, and nothing ties the function
 * to a book switch: its only reference is the retreat state's init word at
 * 0x02114898, it writes daMoray_c's mStateTimer and mHorzSpeed, and it sits
 * inside this unit between two daMoray_c state functions. It keeps that name
 * here because renaming it is a symbols-and-ledger change of its own.
 *
 * Which variant InitResources keeps depends on data_0209f220 (the entrance
 * filter) and whether stars 1 and 2 of sublevel 8 are collected. Variant 2
 * lowers its home and waits in the den. Variant 1 carries a held STAR
 * (actor 178, STAR). Variant 0 swims the path. Anything else returns 0.
 *
 * This file is the whole linker unit 0x021111a0..0x0211260c, 21 functions:
 * D1 and D0 first (the start of ov016 .text, so nothing sits below them),
 * then func_ov016_02111284, which places the hit cylinders, the retreat pair,
 * the fifteen functions from the path-swim execute to InitResources, and
 * last the registry factory daMoray_c_classInit (0x02112588).
 * The out-of-line destructor is the key function, so this TU also emits the
 * vtable and the RTTI. The factory is not `return new daMoray_c()`: that
 * skips the ROM's __cxa_vec_ctor(..., func_0203d384, ...) over mSegmentPos,
 * because types.h's Vector3 has no user-declared constructor (see the
 * factory).
 * `#pragma defer_codegen off` keeps this file in ROM order. It also scopes
 * opt_propagation off on the den-wait execute and opt_strength_reduction
 * off on Render. common.h stays first: the pose reads the flat Matrix4x3
 * words m[9], m[10], m[11].
 *
 * Known limits (kept from the byte-matching recovery, not re-measured):
 * - BlendModelAnim::SetAnim with a Fix12<int> speed grows
 *   func_ov016_02111718 from 0x40 to 0x48 (+2 words). A named local and a
 *   compound literal cost the same. func_ov016_02111860, 02111994 and
 *   02111bac pass that same speed and keep the scalar extern.
 * - dCcAcPos_c::Init with two Fix12 locals grows InitResources from 0x3c8
 *   to 0x3d8 (+4 words) for the first cylinder alone. Both cylinders stay
 *   on the scalar extern.
 * - ApproachLinear(Vector3 &, Vector3 const &, Fix12<int>) grows
 *   func_ov016_02111758 from 0x108 to 0x110 (+2 words). 021118b4 and
 *   021119ec keep the scalar extern.
 * - dActor_c::SetRanges with four Fix12 arguments grows InitResources from
 *   0x3c8 to 0x410 (+0x48). Adding the method to dActor_c.h did not move
 *   the other fourteen functions here; the call still does not match, and
 *   the declaration is not left on the shared header.
 * - `currFrame >> 12` instead of `<< 4 >> 0x10` shrinks func_ov016_02111758
 *   from 0x108 to 0x104 and moves its pool (data_020a0e68 read as
 *   data_0209f220).
 * - GetNode into the stack vector the facing is taken against, instead of
 *   into mPos, is one word of InitResources: `add r1, r4, #0x5c` versus
 *   `add r1, sp, #0x24`. Node 0 is stored on the actor and then overwritten
 *   by node 1.
 * - Collapsing Behavior's star gotos shrinks Behavior from 0x1b0 to 0x1ac.
 * - Deleting `mVariant == 0xff` (the value was just masked to 4 bits)
 *   shrinks InitResources from 0x3c8 to 0x3b8. Deleting `mPathID < 0`
 *   does the same. mwcc still emits both tests.
 * - Deleting the second PathPtr::FromID, whose result is unused, shrinks
 *   InitResources from 0x3c8 to 0x3b4.
 * - Indexing mSegmentPos[i] and transforms[i] shrinks func_ov016_02111c40
 *   from 0x2f8 to 0x2e8. The walk through a daMoray_c* advanced one Vector3
 *   at a time is what the ROM does.
 * - ModelComponents::UpdateBones, passing mBlendModelAnim.file and the same
 *   frame shift, grows Render from 0x8c to 0x9c. Render keeps func_020167a4,
 *   which is that wrapper.
 * - Sound::Play(3, 0xfa, pos) grows func_ov016_02111860 from 0x54 to 0x58.
 *   func_02012694 is Play with bank 3. The other call sites use it too.
 * - The gotos in Behavior and InitResources, and the raw dActor_c+0xc8
 *   carrier cast, are kept from the byte-matching recovery.
 *
 * Leftover (not recovered):
 * - func_ov016_02111284 keeps its `void *` parameter (include/decl_common.h
 *   pins it) and the byte-stepped mSegmentPos walk, the volatile stores of
 *   mPos into va and the c1/c2 locals; those are what the bytes need.
 * - unk_400 is zeroed by the two idle-animation inits and read nowhere in
 *   this file; what it counts is unknown.
 * - Sound id 0xfa (bank 3) has no name here; The held spawn passes
 *   mStarParam | 0x50 and the release spawn mStarParam | 0x40, so 0x10 is the
 *   only bit that differs; what 0x40 means is not decoded here.
 * - The MorayRenderStep table (data_ov016_02114908), the dActor_c+0xc8
 *   carrier word and the BookSwitch_Spawn name have no recovered meaning
 *   beyond what is said here and at their declarations.
