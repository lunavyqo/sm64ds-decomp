/* The GAMAGUCHI hopping purse that pays out coins (ov081/daGmch_c),
 * 37 functions, enrolled and canonical. All 36 helpers are real class
 * methods; the factory is the one free function.
 *
 * Class name is ROM RTTI: "8daGmch_c" at 0x02128bc8, with its
 * __si_class_type_info at 0x02128bd4. The tree used to call it
 * Moneybag; that name is not in the cartridge.
 *
 * Source runs ROM-ascending under defer_codegen off. Do not reorder.
 * The ROM has D1 (0x02126504) below D0 (0x02126554) and no D2:
 * mwccarm emits D1, D0, D2 here and the D2 is deadstripped.
 * common.h comes before daGmch_c.h (flat Matrix4x3 block-move).
 * decl_common.h is deliberately NOT included (it contradicts this
 * TU's own helper spellings).
 *
 * Known limits:
 * - SetAnim / dCcAc Init / dBgCh Init / NewSimple / SpawnCoins /
 *   DropShadowRadHeight / Player::Bounce / Hurt keep computed spellings
 *   (Fix12<int> by value, wall 6az).
 * - GetFloorResult / GetWallResult / TouchesWater are the const methods
 *   on dBgCh_Actr. cstd::fdiv is the integer divide.
 * - dActor_c has no Pos(). PlayBank0 takes the camera-space triple at
 *   mCamSpacePosX through a Vector3 pun (CheckPlayerContact, EnterState8).
 * - unk_0a4 and unk_0ac stay those names. They are dActor_c's world-velocity
 *   X/Z beside mVertSpeed (this TU multiplies them by the floor normal). The
 *   base header still spells them unk_.
 * - ModelCache wants a shared home with da1up_c's copy.
 * - State numbers stay literal: what each state means is not proven (see
 *   daGmch_c.h). mFlags bit 0x80000 and the hit mask 0x66fe0 stay numeric.
 *
 * Leftover: TouchesWater, GetFloorResult and GetWallResult are the const
 * dBgCh_Actr methods. Those two results are still cast to dBgPi*, because
 * the methods return the raw result word and a dBgPi* return disagrees
 * with the definitions. cstd::fdiv is the divide. SpawnCoins written as
 * dActor_c::SpawnCoins was remeasured in SpawnCoinsAndDie and that
 * function stopped matching, so it and the other Fix12-by-value calls
 * stay scalar externs. The sine table is an s16 index, the BCA word is
 * data_ov081_02128edc[1], and the factory is `new daGmch_c()`.
 * CallStateEnter/Update go through mStatePmfPair as daGmch_c::*. mFlags
 * uses &= / |= and mPhase uses ++. Reverted, sizes measured against the
 * ROM: mSpinAngleY += 0xc00 in UpdateState0 is 4 words off at the same
 * 0x158; mPhase = (u8)(mPhase + 1) there is 0x144 against 0x158 (mPhase++
 * matches); holder->mPosX/Y/Z in place of the &mPosX word triple is
 * EnterState7 0x178 against 0x17c and UpdateState6 0x9c against 0xa0.
 * Still the scalar externs for SetAnim, dCcAc_c::Init, dBgCh_Actr::Init,
 * SpawnCoins, DropShadowRadHeight, Player::Bounce, Player::Hurt and
 * Particle::NewSimple (Fix12<int> by value). ApproachLinear2 still sees
 * &mState as an int* because mState/mPhase/mTimer are one word.
 * Vec3_26e28 and the *(Vector3 *)&mPosX
 * / mCamSpacePosX puns stay: a real Vector3 runs ~Vector3, and dActor_c
 * has no Pos(). ModelCache stays file-local. GmchDrawReg is the
 * one-slot init sentinel the folded sinit needs; see its comment.

/* External function bridges used by class methods, with C linkage.

 * gets C++ linkage and the reference mangles.  The bridges used by these
 * methods are declared once here. The factory is `new daGmch_c()` and does
 * not redeclare the member constructors.
 *
 * Of the original 54 declarations, exactly NINE had more than one type spelling
 * across the 36 shards: Vec3_Dist, dActor_c::DistToCPlayer, func_02038414,
 * ModelAnim::SetAnim, Vec3_HorzAngle, DecIfAbove0_Byte, Sound::PlayBank0,
 * ApproachLinear and RandomIntInternal.  Collapsing each onto ONE spelling was
 * measured, not assumed, and eight of the nine cost nothing:
 *
 *   TWO were never different types at all.  Fix12i is `typedef s32`, so
 *   Vec3_Dist and dActor_c::DistToCPlayer spelt `Fix12i` and spelt `int` are
 *   the same declaration written twice.
 *
 *   FIVE disagreed only about something no call site can see: a return value
 *   that every caller discards or compares against zero (func_02038414,
 *   ModelAnim::SetAnim, DecIfAbove0_Byte) or which pointer type spells the same
 *   address (Vec3_HorzAngle, ModelAnim::SetAnim, and ApproachLinear, which
 *   takes the short & its mangled name encodes).
 *
 *   ONE needed a call site adapted rather than a declaration chosen.
 *   Sound::PlayBank0's position is the camera-space triple, passed as
 *   *(Vector3 *)&mCamSpacePosX because dActor_c has no Pos().
 *   Same address, same register, and the member still matches.
 *
 * The NINTH is genuinely load-bearing: RandomIntInternal must return
 * `unsigned int`.  Measured -- declaring it `int` leaves 36/37 matching and
 * breaks ChooseNextState alone, which is the only caller that takes `% 10` of
 * the result and so the only one that pays for a signed remainder.
 *
 * Data is different -- mwccarm leaves a file-scope variable's name unmangled in
 * C++ -- so every `data_*` declaration stays at block scope in the member that
 * recovered it.  The sinit's own five handles and the PMF state table moved
 * here wholesale as file-scope definitions: GmchModelFileHandle /
 * GmchAnimationFileHandle spell the model/animation ctors and dtors, and
 * GmchDrawReg supplies the draw offset's .init stores so the plain Vector3
 * earns its registered destructor instead of constant initialization. */
