/* daBbl_c -- the Lava Bubble (Podoboo), BUBBLE, ov064
 * 0x021185c0..0x02118b50.
 *
 * The Lava Bubble of the lava levels. Two variants share the class, chosen
 * by the spawn parameter's low bit: a fixed flame that only hurts what walks
 * into it, and the jumping bubble that leaps out of the lava under gravity,
 * can be hit, and dies when its fuse runs out. Both run the same two-entry
 * pointer-to-member state table.
 *
 * Source order is the reverse of the ROM: mwccarm 2004/b56 emits one .text
 * section per function in reverse source order, so the highest-address
 * function is written first. Do not reorder. The inline destructor in
 * include/daBbl_c.h emits the retail D1/D0 pair first and no D2 body.
 *
 * Leftovers:
 * - Particle::System::New, dActor_c::IsTooFarAwayFromPlayer, dCcAc_c::Init
 *   and dBgCh_Actr::Init keep their C ABI spellings: their real declarations
 *   pass Fix12<int> by value, which mwccarm lowers differently at a C++ call
 *   site.
 * - The five state hooks keep their address labels as method names; the ROM
 *   records no English name for them.
 * - The two State tables at 0x0211c7b8/0x0211c7c8 are this overlay's .bss.
 *   This TU's static initializer copies the four .data pointer-to-member
 *   constants into them.
 * - func_ov064_02118760's volatile spawn-position array is load-bearing:
 *   retail stores the words y, z, x; a plain Vector3 lets mwcc reorder the
 *   stores.
