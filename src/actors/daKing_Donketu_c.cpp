/**
 * daKing_Donketu_c -- Chief Chilly (KING_DONKETU 218), ov073.
 *
 * Snowman's Land's ice-bully boss, derived from dEnemyBase_c (ROM RTTI; not
 * from daOts_c). Sixteen file-scope state records drive it; mState holds the
 * address of the current one, ChiefChilly_ChangeState stores it and runs its
 * enter member, and Behavior runs its update member every frame.
 *
 * THE STATE RECORDS. Each record is two pointers-to-member, {enter, update},
 * filled in by ov073's sinit (__sinit_ov073_02122874). The pairs below were
 * read off that sinit; the descriptions are what the handlers do, and the
 * labels are mine -- the cartridge's names for these states are not recovered.
 * (Fix12: 0x1000 = 1.0; angles: 0x10000 = a full turn.)
 *
 *   record     enter     update    what the pair does
 *   ---------  --------  --------  ---------------------------------------
 *   ..3330     ..1538    ..1388    opening talk: the player is addressed,
 *                                  message (param1 + 0xe3) is shown. The
 *                                  state InitResources starts in.
 *   ..3350     ..1378    ..128c    opening talk, camera held until the
 *                                  player's talk state reads -1.
 *   ..3360     ..122c    ..0ed0    the main chase: charge at the player,
 *                                  brake, turn; hits are checked here (and in
 *                                  ..3390).
 *   ..3390     ..0e60    ..0dec    turn back toward mSpawnPos (entered from
 *                                  the chase when the ground ray misses).
 *   ..33a0     ..0d80    ..0c7c    hit reaction: slide to a stop; when the
 *                                  ground ray misses, mHitsRemaining drops.
 *   ..33c0     ..0c08    ..0b78    leap (20.0 out, 30.0 up) until the boss is
 *                                  below mSpawnPosY and on the ground, then
 *                                  face mSpawnPos and go to ..3400.
 *   ..3400     ..081c    ..0610    waypoint hop whose landing sets mJumpCount
 *                                  to 1 and returns to ..3320.
 *   ..3320     ..05f0    ..03ac    waypoint hops, counting landings.
 *   ..3340     ..0390    ..00e0    leap toward mSpawnPos; while falling it
 *                                  calls Player::Unk_020c6a10 on the player
 *                                  touching it if the boss is the higher.
 *   ..3380     ..0098    ..005c    pose until the animation finishes, then
 *                                  back to the chase.
 *   ..33d0     ..0ad8    ..0910    wobble (mAngleX) while moving toward a
 *                                  point 120.0 past the position where the
 *                                  ground ray last missed; when
 *                                  mStateTimer (0x5a frames) runs out it sets
 *                                  mHitsRemaining to 1 and goes to ..3340; a
 *                                  nonzero 0211f61c (a hit, or the
 *                                  boss hurting the player) goes to ..33f0.
 *   ..33f0     ..08e4    ..0844    leap, tilting mAngleX toward -0x4000, until
 *                                  it is below mSpawnPosY and on the ground,
 *                                  then ..33b0.
 *   ..33b0     ..000c    ..fe8c    cut scene, part 1: StartTalk the player,
 *                                  camera on the boss, until mStateTimer (0x32
 *                                  frames) runs out.
 *   ..33e0     ..fe84    ..fc78    cut scene, part 2: message (param1 + 0xe7).
 *   ..3410     ..fc70    ..fbf4    cut scene, part 3: camera held until the
 *                                  talk state reads -1.
 *   ..3370     ..fbec    ..fa74    defeat: shrink, spawn the key, vanish.
 *
 * (Addresses are data_ov073_0212xxxx and func_ov073_0211/0212xxxx, with the
 * last four hex digits shown; ..fe84 is 0211fe84 and so on.) The three
 * enter handlers fbec / fc70 / fe84 are empty.
 *
 * mHitsRemaining starts at 3 and is decremented by the hit-reaction state
 * (..33a0). The states that end in the defeat chain together as
 * ..33d0 -> ..33f0 -> ..33b0 -> ..33e0 -> ..3410 -> ..3370, each hop being a
 * transition its update handler makes. There are two waypoint sets and a
 * ground-ray guard in Behavior.
 *
 * DO NOT "TIDY" THESE -- each one is load-bearing:
 *
 *   `#pragma defer_codegen off` (file-global). Out-of-line D1, then D0, then a
 *   homeless D2 is the cartridge's order; with codegen deferred mwccarm emits
 *   D2, D0, D1 instead.
 *
 *   `#pragma opt_loop_invariants off` (file-global), for func_ov073_0211f61c.
 *
 *   common.h must be included first. Otherwise BlendModelAnim.h's nested
 *   Matrix4x3 wins and the twelve-word copies size-DIFF.
 *
 *   The struct C / V3 / Vec3 / Mtx43 / Base / Bool shadows, for PMF
 *   dispatch, the Render vcall and the POD triples. `struct C` is complete
 *   here on purpose: mwccarm 2004/b56 picks its pointer-to-member
 *   representation from completeness.
 *
 *   The sizeof wrap in the header (0x504).
 *
 * WHY SO MANY CALLS ARE SPELLED AS MANGLED SYMBOLS. Reasons (a) and (c) below
 * explain the calls they list. The other mangled externs (the UpdatePos family,
 * dCc_c, the constructors, the loaders, Sound::PlayLong, Message::PrepareTalk)
 * are spelled that way because the bytes or the available headers needed it;
 * (b) lists the calls that are real member calls:
 *
 *   (a) Fix12<int> passed by value -- wall 6az. A method call homes the
 *       argument and the bytes move. This is BlendModelAnim::SetAnim,
 *       Particle::System::New, Particle::System::NewSimple,
 *       Particle::RunningSlidingDustAt, Player::Hurt,
 *       Sound::ChangeMusicVolume, DropShadowRadHeight and cstd::atan2.
 *       Their callers are func_ov073_0211f144 / 0211f2c0 / 0211f494 /
 *       0211f61c / 0211fa74 / 0211fe8c / 0212000c / 021200e0 / 021203ac /
 *       02120610 / 02120ad8 / 02120c08 / 02120c7c / 02120ed0 / 0212122c /
 *       02121538 / 021215cc.
 *
 *   (b) The calls that are NOT mangled are real member calls now that the
 *       helpers take daKing_Donketu_c *: dActor_c::FindWithID /
 *       ClosestPlayer / HorzAngleToCPlayer / DistToCPlayer / Spawn /
 *       PoofDustAt / HugeLandingDustAt / JumpedOnByPlayer / FindWithActorID;
 *       dCamera_c::SetLookAt / SetPos; fBase_c::MarkForDestruction;
 *       dExtFrameCtrl_c::Finished / WillHitFrame (through mBlendModelAnim);
 *       dBgCh_Actr::IsOnGround (mWithMeshClsn); Player::StartTalk /
 *       ShowMessage / GetTalkState / GetHurtState / Unk_020c6a10;
 *       Message::EndTalk; SaveData::IsCharacterUnlocked.
 *
 *   (c) No declaration exists to call: Particle.h has no System::NewSimple;
 *       dCamera_c::SetFlag_3 is a real method but is not on dCamera_c.h; Sound.h has
 *       PlayLong but not Layer3 Load/Stop. Particle::System::FromUniqueID is
 *       on Particle__System.h, but this TU pokes sys+0x44 after the call
 *       (the word lies in Particle::System's unnamed pad_042 bytes).
 *       The Vec3_* / Matrix4x3_* / ApproachLinear family (HorzAngle,
 *       VertAngle, HorzLen, Sub, Lsl, Asr, FromRotationY, FromTranslation,
 *       ApplyInPlaceToRotationX, ApplyInPlaceToRotationXYZExt, MulVec3Mat4x3,
 *       MulMat4x3Mat4x3) has no shared header this TU can take without a
 *       campaign across its other consumers.
 *
 * NOT OWNED BY THIS TU. State records are still dispatched as PMFs through
 * the struct C shadow. Of the function and data
 * symbols only ChiefChilly_ChangeState is coined (an English gloss for the
 * dispatcher); the member names, the enums and the state labels in the
 * table are descriptions, not recovered names.
 * data_02082214 is the NitroSDK FX_SinCosTable_
 * (func_ov073_0211f494 indexes it) and naming it belongs with the SDK table;
 * data_0209f318 (camera), data_020a0e68 (scratch matrix) and data_0209e650
 * (RNG seed) are arm9 globals, as are func_02012694 (sound), func_0200d8c8
 * (camera shake), func_0200fa8c and func_02011cfc. data_ov002_0210da30 is
 * ov002's and Cleanup only Releases it; naming belongs in ov002.
 * g_profile_KING_DONKETU lives outside this TU (S14).
 *
 * SCOPE. All 47 of the class's functions, 0x0211f000..0x02121f90: the whole
 * tu_map unit (0x0211f000..0x02121ec8) plus the abutting registry factory
 * daKing_Donketu_c_classInit (0x02121ec8..0x02121f90), written last. Behavior
 * needs `opt_propagation off`, which at file scope recompiles eight other
 * members; here it is a push/pop bracket around Behavior alone (see the note
 * above Behavior for why the closing pop sits behind a declaration).
 * daKing_Donketu_c_classInit is a reconstructed name (RTTI daKing_Donketu_c,
 * KING_DONKETU registry); retail does not store that spelling, and the
 * historical alias was ChiefChilly_Spawn. It keeps the hand-built
 * construction rather than `return new` (see the note above it).
 *
 * Function order is ROM-ascending, not reversed.
 *
 * Leftover: 47/47 MATCH after the method batch. No spelling DIFFed, so
 * nothing was reverted.
 *   - ChiefChilly_ChangeState's first parameter is C* (the PMF shadow), not
 *     char* or void* cast to daKing_Donketu_c. It stays the coined dispatcher.
 *   - Actor fields the header already names are member reads. Left raw, and
 *     not a class field this header names: dCamera_c +0x114 (pad_114),
 *     Particle::System +0x44, and the data_020a0e68 translation words
 *     (`.m[9..11]` moves bytes).
 *   - The cartridge's names for the sixteen states and for the func_ov073_*
 *     handlers; the labels in the table are descriptions. The state records
 *     are dispatched through the `struct C` shadow, not a real PMF member.
 *   - dCamera_c +0x114 (Behavior publishes `this` there): dCamera_c.h has it inside
 *     pad_114. Particle::System +0x44 likewise. Both stay raw.
 *   - What the ground ray's miss means (mNoGroundAhead) and how that
 *     relates to the mHitsRemaining counter: see the notes in the
 *     header; the reading is from the handlers, not from retail strings.
 *   - unk_4a8..4b0, unk_4c5, unk_4ca, unk_4d0 and unk_4d4 keep their offset
 *     names; each has a comment saying what the code does with it.
 *   - The hit-flag masks in func_ov073_0211f61c are literals: dCc_c.h's bit
 *     table is itself a best-effort reading and bit 0x10000 is not in it.
 *   - The sound ids are named for the site that plays them; no sound table
 *     was consulted.
 *   - Spellings kept ONLY because the bytes need them (each measured: the
 *     alternative was compiled and the object compared): `void *cam` (not
 *     dCamera_c *) in func_ov073_0211fa74 / 0212128c / 02121388, where the
 *     typed pointer swaps two registers; the (unsigned short) reads of
 *     mStateTimer and of mAngleX/Y/Z in func_ov073_0211fa74 (the members are
 *     s16, the cartridge loads them with ldrh and a plain read gives ldrsh);
 *     the `s16 *py` pointer behind mPrevAngleY in func_ov073_0211f61c and
 *     func_ov073_02120d80; `const s32 *pv = &x->mPosX` walks (a direct member read
 *     emits different addressing); array-indexed unk_4d4[i] in the dust
 *     loops (a Vector3 pointer walk hoists the base); `*(void **)&c->mState`
 *     in func_ov073_0211f2c0 (a plain member read is shared with the later
 *     load, the cartridge reloads it); the data_020a0e68 translation words
 *     read through (char *) in the same function (`.m[9..11]` changes bytes).

       coin counts into mCoinsSpawned and the one that takes it past 0x1e also
       spawns a SCALEUP_KINOKO and resets the count. Then the boss goes to
       ..33a0 unless it is already in ..33a0 or ..33d0.

       SND_HIT_REGISTERED plays and the function returns 1. Elsewhere the boss turns mPrevAngleY by half a turn

       unk_4d0 0x2000 and mStateTimer 0x1e, and the function still returns 0. */

            the leg continues; otherwise leg 1 with unk_4d0 = 0x1000 and
            SND_CHASE_BRAKE. While the timer runs: mHorzSpeed approaches
            0x1e000 (30.0) by 0x3000, mPrevAngleY turns toward mTargetAngle by
            0x1d0, and the first time the player is within 0x1f4000 (500.0)
            there is a one-in-eight chance of leg 3 (speed zeroed,
            mStateTimer 0xf).
     leg 3  when mStateTimer is 0: unk_4d0 = 0x1000, leg 1.
     legs 1, 2  mHorzSpeed is braked to 0 by unk_4d0 with the dust following
            while it is above 0xa; leg 1 also turns mAngleY toward the player
            by 0x500. When |mHorzSpeed| < 0xa and mStateTimer is 0, leg 2
            first retargets (to mSpawnPos if the player's hurt state reads 4 or
            5 or it is mIsNoControl, else to the player), then the boss stops,
            restarts the animation and returns to leg 0 with mStateTimer 0x1e.
   In leg 0 the model hitting animation frame 0 or 0xe shakes the camera
   (0x3e8000) and plays SND_CHASE_STEP. */

 * One frame of the boss. Almost everything here is gated on WHICH state is
 * current, compared by ADDRESS against the file-scope state records, and it
 * gates five separate things rather than one:
 *
 *   three states       use UpdatePosWithOnlySpeed instead of UpdatePos, and
 *                      apply gravity by hand first: mVertSpeed becomes
 *                      max(mTerminalVelocity, mVertSpeed + mVertAccel)
 *   two states         at animation frame 7, build a world matrix from the
 *                      model's own bone and spawn the landing dust there --
 *                      the impact is tied to the ANIMATION, not to contact
 *   seven states       skip the ground ray entirely
 *   one more           is exempt from the rewind below
 *   two states         get an extra per-frame call
 *
 * THE GROUND RAY IS A FALL-THROUGH GUARD. It starts 120.0 (0x78000) above the
 * boss and runs along mPrevAngleY, tilted by 0x2000 (45 degrees) about X, for
 * 300.0 (0x12c000) -- 600.0 while mHitsRemaining > 1. When it finds NOTHING it
 * saves the current position into mGroundMissPos and, outside the ..33a0
 * state, rewinds mPos to the previous position and zeroes mHorzSpeed -- so the
 * boss from walking off in the states that run the ray. Finding ground clears mNoGroundAhead;
 * a miss while moving faster than 0xa000 (10.0) sets it.
 *
 * The first thing it does is store `this` into the camera object at +0x114
 * (dCamera_c.h has that word inside pad_114). What the camera does with it is not
 * recovered here.
 *
 * `opt_propagation off` is what stops the many position temporaries being
 * folded. It is bracketed to this one member: under `defer_codegen off` above,
 * the bracket binds positionally, so the members before and after it keep
 * the file's default propagation. The closing `#pragma pop` must NOT follow
 * Behavior's closing brace directly: the parser reads one token past the `}`
 * before generating the body, so a pop there is already in force when
 * Behavior is compiled and Behavior no longer matches. The extern block below
 * Behavior (the declarations InitResources needs) is what keeps it clear.
