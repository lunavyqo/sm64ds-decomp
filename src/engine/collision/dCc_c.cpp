/* The cylinder-collision root (arm9 .text 0x02014aa8..0x020150e8): dCc_c, the
 * intrusive-list node that dCcPos_c, dCcAc_c and dCcAcPos_c derive from.
 * Process() walks the global list whose head is data_0209cee8, finds pairs
 * whose flags interlock, and writes per-node pushback; the two file-static
 * helpers resolve a flag-8 hit's owner to the player actor and notify it.
 * mwccarm emits .text in reverse source order, so the definitions below run
 * ROM-descending.
 *
 * ~dCc_c() is the key function: mwcc emits D2, D0 and D1 from the one
 * definition and the cartridge keeps all three (0x02015058 / 0x0201507c /
 * 0x020150a8). The complete-object ctor variant C1 is the homeless copy --
 * the ROM keeps only C2 at 0x020150cc, which every derived constructor
 * enters through the base chain. The vtable/RTTI records land in .data as
 * compiler-emitted output externalized to the canonical bytes
 * (_ZTS5dCc_c 0x0208e658, _ZTI5dCc_c 0x0208e660, _ZTV5dCc_c 0x0208e6ec).
