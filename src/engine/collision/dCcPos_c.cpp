/* Positional collision cylinders (arm9 .text 0x020147bc..0x0201489c):
 * dCcPos_c, the dCc_c leaf that carries its own position -- a fixed
 * cylinder, not bound to an actor, which is why GetOwnerID is a constant
 * 0 and GetPos returns the member at +0x30.
 * mwccarm emits .text in reverse source order, so the definitions below
 * run ROM-descending.
 *
 * ~dCcPos_c() is the key function: the vtable _ZTV8dCcPos_c (0x0208e6bc)
 * emits from this TU with slots [D1 0x02014854, D0 0x02014828, GetPos
 * 0x02014820, GetOwnerID 0x02014818]. The class's RTTI records exist in
 * the cartridge -- _ZTS8dCcPos_c at 0x0208e674 and _ZTI8dCcPos_c at
 * 0x0208e68c, a __si_class_type_info on dCc_c -- so the records
 * externalize as deadstrip-data at their configured homes; C2 and D2 are
 * the homeless variants, licensed compiler-only.
