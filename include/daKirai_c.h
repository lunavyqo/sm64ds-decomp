/* Seeded from matched-function evidence by tools/gen_header.py, then given its
 * real base and real member types by hand.
 *
 * class daKirai_c: 5 matched functions.
 *
 * Two sub-objects, each checked twice -- once by that class's own size assertion,
 * once by closing exactly on the next named field:
 *
 *     dActor_c                      0x000 + 0x0d0 = 0x0d0   -> pad_0d0
 *     Model                      0x0d4 + 0x050 = 0x124   -> mdCcAcPos_c
 *     dCcAcPos_c  0x124 + 0x040 = 0x164   -> padding, then mStateIndex
 *
 * mdCcAcPos_c was a `u8` marker with 0x4b bytes of pad behind it.
 * The pad was the object: the class's own destructor calls
 * dCcAcPos_c's D1 at +0x124, and 0x40 lands exactly where the next
 * declared field starts.
 *
 * sizeof is 0x1b0, and it IS the field span: the last field mOpacity ends at 0x1af.
 *
 * It used to say 0x32c, "not inferred from the fields", on the authority of
 * daKpa3Bg_c_classInit -- a DIFFERENT CLASS's factory. That is the pair-by-name
 * error: daKirai_c_classInit is the factory that stores _ZTV9daKirai_c, and it asks
 * fBase_c::operator new for 0x1b0. BowserSkyPlatform's own assert is 0x32c and is
 * correct; this class simply inherited its number, and 0x17d bytes of tail padding
 * were invented to reach it.
 *
 * Field NAMES for the unk_ entries are placeholders. */
