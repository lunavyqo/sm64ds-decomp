/* Derives from dEnemyBase_c, on the evidence of its own destructor: `_ZN18daWater_Tatumaki_cD1Ev`
 * stores this vtable, destroys its members in reverse declaration order, then
 * calls `dEnemyBase_c::~dEnemyBase_c`. Everything this header used to restate below 0x110
 * belongs to that chain and is inherited now.
 *
 * The members close exactly on one another:
 *
 *     0x114 ModelAnim                  0x64   -> 0x178
 *     0x178 TextureTransformer         0x14   -> 0x18c
 *
 * Typing them absorbed these markers, which were a member's insides:
 *   - 0x184 unk_184      = mTextureTransformer.speed (dExtFrameCtrl_c +0x0c)
 *
 * Member NAMES are the ones this header already used -- a rebase should not
 * also rename things its callers spell.
 *
 * SIZE IS THE OBSERVED FIELD SPAN, rounded up. It guards this declaration; it
 * is not independent evidence about the ROM.
 *
 * SM64DS RTTI names the implementation daWater_Tatumaki_c. The reconstructed factory
 * daWater_Tatumaki_c_classInit (historical alias Whirlpool_Spawn) installs this class's
 * cartridge vtable; the reconstructed profile global g_profile_WATER_TATUMAKI
 * (historical alias Whirlpool_SpawnInfo) is its registry descriptor.
